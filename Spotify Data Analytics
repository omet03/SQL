--This spotify data was dowloanded from Kaggle. I created a table to insert the spotify data into

--Creating the table
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )
;

--Displays all the data in the table
SELECT * FROM Bit_DB.Spotifydata
;

--I then explored the following queries using SQL 

--Query 1: What are the top 10 most popular tracks?
SELECT track_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10
;

-- Query 2: What is the average danceability for all the tracks in the data set?
SELECT avg(danceability)
FROM  Spotifydata
;

--Query 3: How many tracks are in mode 1?
SELECT count(song_mode)
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE song_mode = 1
;

--Query 4: How many tracks are in mode 0?
SELECT count(song_mode)
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE song_mode = 0
;

--Query 5: What are the names of the artists that have more than one track in the top 50?
SELECT artist_name,
count(artist_name)
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING count(artist_name) > 1
; 

--Query 6: Which track has the longest duration?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, max(duration_ms)
FROM Spotifydata
;

--Query 7: List all tracks that have an acousticness score above 0.5?
SELECT track_name, acousticness
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE acousticness> 0.5
;

--Query 8: Which track has the highest energy score and who is the artist?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, max(energy)
FROM Spotifydata
;

--Query 9: How many tracks have a liveness score greater than 0.08?
SELECT count(liveness)
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE liveness > 0.08
;

--Query 10: What is the number of Tracks by Olivia Rodrigo
SELECT count(track_name)
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'
;

--Query 11: What tracks have a popularity of more than 90 and a danceability of more than 0.5?
SELECT track_name, popularity, danceability
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE popularity>90
AND danceability > 0.5
;


--Query 12: What are the top 5 fastest songs?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, tempo
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY tempo desc
LIMIT 5
;

--Query 13: Create A top star table using a CTE
WITH TopStarTable AS (
SELECT s.artist_name, AVG(s.popularity) as Popularity_Average
FROM Spotifydata s
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
SELECT artist_name, Popularity_Average,
'Top Star' AS tag
FROM TopStarTable
WHERE Popularity_Average>= 90
;
