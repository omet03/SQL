--Query 1: How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT (*) AS NumberOfJanSales
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
;

--Query 2: How many of those orders were for an IPhone?
SELECT COUNT (*) AS NumberOfJanSales
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
AND Product = 'iPhone'
;

--Query 3: Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in february 
SELECT distinct acctnum 
FROM BIT_DB.customers

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID

WHERE length(orderID) =6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
;

--Query 4: Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM JanSales 
WHERE price = (SELECT MIN(price) FROM JanSales)
GROUP BY product
;

--Query 5:What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price
FROM JanSales 
GROUP BY product
;

--Query 6: Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product,
SUM(Quantity) as NumberOfEachProductSold,
SUM(Quantity) * price AS TotalRevenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product
;

--Query 7: How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT 
count(distinct customers.acctnum),
avg(Quantity *price)
FROM FebSales

LEFT JOIN customers
ON customers.order_ID =FebSales.orderID

WHERE Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
